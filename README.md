# Electro App ⚡️

This is simple RN app done for the assignment and fun ⚡️.

Time planned to do: 1-1.5 hours.

Development focused on iOS React Native app, 
no support for Android and web for now.

Overall work done:
- data fetching implemented
- graph shown

[Gifted charts](https://gifted-charts.web.app/linechart) used for the graph

Not done, but needed:
- interactivity for the graph
- tests for fetching and the data functions
- refactor different react components from App (for now it's not too much)
- check the actual data and dates :)
- use date-fns for dates

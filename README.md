# Electro App ⚡️

This is simple RN app done for the assignment and fun ⚡️.

Development focused on iOS React Native app, 
no support for Android and web for now.

Overall work done:
- data fetching implemented
- graph shown

This was implemtented overall for 3 hours

[Victory charts](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory) used for the graph


Not done, but needed:
- [ ] interactivity for the graph
- [ ] icon for the app
- [ ]tests for fetching and the data functions
- [x] use date-fns for dates
- [x] check the actual data and dates :)
- [ ] refactor different react components from App (for now it's not too much)

npm i
cd ios && bundle exec pod install
